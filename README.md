# Today I Learned

I love sharing knowledge and one of the common ways to take action is writing blog posts. However, my currently blog posts are kind of technical and, hence, challenging to keep this as a routine.
Well we could write anything we've learned (not only iOS but also general programming, UX, work productivity...)

Just share (constantly)!
